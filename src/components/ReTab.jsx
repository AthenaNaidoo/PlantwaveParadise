        <h3>
          Goals, theory and execution:
        </h3>
      <p>
      I wanted to create a unique website inspired by visual design ideas that I find interesting. I wanted the websites design to make reference to old web design practises while still upholding various functional aspects of modern webdesign such as readability, simplicity and convenience. 
      I wish to achieve this by utilizing and being mindful of modern web design conventions (format of pages, interactivity (providing appropriate feedback to the users inputs) and simplicity) while also tying in visual elements that tie into the ideas of Plantwave.
      </p>
      <article className='Design-Colour'>
        <h3>
          Colour palette:
        </h3>
        <img src={Hex} alt="color palette"/>
        <p>
          The website will mainly be in greyscale, using various shades of grey. The other elements of colour on the website will come mostly from 
          various images and videos of nature and plants. The pinks and blues are there as preposed accent colour to provide contrast, break up visual elements, draw the users attention to specific elements or provide feedback to the user.

        <h3>
          Typography and Font:
        </h3>
        <p>
          I want to use a mix of the chicago which was the font used on the classic mac os, Jacquard 12 which is a google font (for strange art and neon text), the default font and Chakra Petch which is another google font.

      <p>
      The design gets more stranger an experimental as you venture further into the site. 
      This wasnâ€™t my original plan but as I carried on working on both the website as a whole 
      and the Internet Artwork I just started to experiment more with the css styling because of 
      all the different inspirations I was coming into contact with.
