                    This is one of the art elements I wanted to add to my website to flesh it out a bit more and also really achieve the UX i wanted for my website. 
                    The initial idea was came from looking at tutorials of portfolio pages. I noticed the general layouts and design directions most of them took. 
                    I decided that I wanted to have a really simple or minimalist main page but because of by fairly bland or plain colour pallett I wanted to add 
                    an eye catching element that would act to set the overall mood of the site. My idea was to create a window into nature, tying in my plantwave 
                    theme. I wanted the looping image to have text that scrolls over it, the text being quotes or lyrics that I find interesting (I thik this is 
                    an introduction to me instead of having a typical about page- I’ll possibly have some sort of equvalant) I want to add audio to this element as 
                    well.

                        Fish Tank
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                    This was a part of what I wanted to do for my art piece. I wanted to create a piece of art that uses ascii art because it is a interesting art for that 
                    is purley exists digitally and is mostly propagated through the internet. I was inspired by old vhs recordings of fish tanks and the feelings that watching 
                    them invoked. I wanted to translate or attempt to capture that feeling in a way typical to vaporwave and its many sub genres, by obscuring it to some extent.
                     My idea was to make a digital fish tank using ascii fish that swim across the screen.&lt; &gt; &lt;

                    <p>
                    A made pixel art of some playing cards loosely inspired by old solitaire computer games. I thought it would be a fun little interactive element to add to my page. 
                    As an element I also thought it would contribute to the nostalgia aspect of my theme.

                    I’m having mostly issues with styling. All of which I’m still having or have been really tedious to fix.

                    <p>
                        I've completely reworked the blog section from my original idea. The inspiration for this new look came from the "So heavy I fell through the Earth" by grimes music video. I decided it needed to be re done after getting some feedback from my family. I've added pixel art I made as well as more plant images. An I've deided to use a pink accent on all of the Blog page entries.
